Prob: Joon code <- react (not html page), my code <- html page based. So need to convert to react way.
    => NEED TO SETUP FOR REACT WITH FIREBASE
1. Generated firebase-config.js file
    This will contains firebase config
2. Modify App.tsx with firebase db
    *** seems like we need to hide api key somehow (.env)
    commands below:
        npm install -g yarn
        yarn add firebase
        yarn start
        -> firebase is already added in this case, so need to yarn start from now on    
    ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCY6DH8F4oc
3. generate build by using yarn
    comands: yarn build
    check commands: serve -s build 
3. Web hosting
    1) hosting initialization
        command: firebase init hosting 
            Are you ready to proceed? Yes
            Please select an option: Use an existing project
            Select a default Firebase project for this diretory: the-oh--code (The OH  Code)
            What do you want to use as your public directory? src  ***( this should be build)
            Congure as a single-page app(rewrite all urls to /index.html)? No
            File src/404.html already exists. Overwrite? No
            File src/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No
    2) trouble shooting firebase.json 
        "public": "src", -> "public": "build",
    3) start hosting  
        command: firebase deploy --only hosting        
        Debug tip: firebase emulators:start --only hosting
        -> This takes some time to hosting!
    4) use .env file to save apikey
        install command: npm install dotenv --save
        create .env file, including apikey, appid, ...
        change firebase-config.js : part firebaseConfig with proces.env.*
        generate .gitignore of .env file
        -> have trouble --> removed, and gitignore for firebase-config.js
